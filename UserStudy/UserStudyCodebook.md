How well the AI builds trust by explaining its reasoning, providing supporting evidence, and increasing user confidence in identifying phishing attempts or understanding the legitimacy of messages. | 60 | "...the AI agent explains or give enough reason as to why you may be at threat. It gives me good reason to trust it by explaining into details for me..." <br>"It provided detailed and knowledgeable reasons to explain how some of those can be phishing attempts..." |
|  |  | **Concerns about explanation length** | User concerns about the verbosity of AI responses and the impact of message length on readability and user experience. Suggestions to shorten responses, streamline explanations, and improve clarity to make the AI's outputs more intuitive and engaging. | 14 | "... I would improve upon the system by supplying a tad less information, unless requested."<br>"the responses were a bit wordy, not too bad though" |
|  |  | **Additional detailed explanation** | AI's ability to provide layered responses, offering both concise explanations and more detailed follow-up information as needed. Appreciation for features like evidence (e.g., screenshots or additional data) that enhance trust and confidence in the AI's assessments. | 9 | "I liked that it could provide evidence if I wasn't confident about the results that it was yielding. The screenshot of the pages were helpful for me to see what the website looked like and made it easier to trust AI"<br>"...I especially liked being able to see the additional information - seeing the screenshots and knowing that the AI agent looked into several different aspects helped me feel better about the validity of the decisions." |
|  |  | **Educational value and learning support** | AI's ability to educate users about phishing, scams, and online safety. How the AI increases tech literacy, provides examples for learning, and acts as a tutorial to enhance user confidence and decision-making. | 7 | "... The explanations as to why a SMS was legitimate or phishing was very clear and educational as well. I found myself making more confident choices as to the legitimacy of the SMS simply by reading the explanations as a tutorial..." |
|  |  | **Issues with clarity and context** | User concerns related to difficulties in understanding the AI's reasoning, maintaining contextual relevance, and improving message formatting and depth. How these issues impact the usability and trustworthiness of the AI. | 4 | "It was sometimes difficult to understand the reasoning behind the AI decision."<br>"The formatting of the message could be a bit long and tedious to read. Some of the terms used could be confusing as well." |

Both positive feedback about quick feedback and efficiency, as well as negative feedback regarding delays or slow text appearance | **Fast and efficient** | Positive feedback about quick feedback and efficiency | 12 | "...The results were quick and easy to understand."<br>"I really like the quick analysis of whether a message was legitimate or fraudulent..." |
|  |  | **Slow** | Negative feedback regarding delays or slow text appearance | 3 | "Only complaint is the relatively slow typeback from the AI. Over numerous texts I would find that tedious." |
| **Link Verification Ability** | AI's ability to analyze links. User appreciation for features like detecting spoofed links, analyzing website domains, and providing reliable information without requiring the user to click on the link. |  |  | 9 | "...I also like that it is able to actually analyze the content on the link to help it determine if it's a real link or not."<br>"...I love that the AI agent was able to view the links and provide information on the where the page leads without the user clicking onto the link." |
| **Help Elders** | AI can assist older adults or vulnerable populations in identifying phishing and scams. |  |  | 3 | "... I wish my parents had this to know not to open strange links."<br>"It would be very helpful to people that are easily duped, like little old ladies, etc..." |
| **Suggestions for Improvement** | Users' suggestions for potential further improvement | **Improved visual indicators** | Users' suggestions on the visual indicators of the system. This includes the color indicator or word warnings. As well as other UI designs. | 6 | "...Perhaps highlighting potentially dangerous messages red with an exclamation, or yellow for unsure messages would accomplish the goal of safety better. Then, for more info, the AI explanation button could still be available."<br>"I think the AI agent explains to much initially. It should give a quick 'go'/'no go' first with a sentence with the strongest proof, then provide more information if you click more info..." |
|  |  | **Suggestion for the survey itself** | Users' suggestion or complain about the user study itself, rather than about the system. | 5 | "...I do need to recommend that you tell us not to put ourselves into the message..." |
|  |  | **Clarity in responses** | Users' concerns about the clarity of the responses. | 4 | "AI responses can sometimes be overly complex or lack human warmth.

|  |  | **Warnings for all shortened URL** |Users' suggestion for giving all shortened URL a red flag. | 2 | "The system should warn for any and all URL shorteners. No organization with minimally competent leadership should be sending out any bit.ly urls; a company should have their own dedicated URL shortener that clients/customers can immediately recognize as a legitimate URL..." |
|  |  | **Hide links at first** |Users' suggestion for hiding all the links in the SMS at first. | 1 | "If it works and is more integrated so it automatically checks messages and hides links unless you click 'show link' then it could help prevent people from getting scammed..." |
|  |  | **Access to report phishing** |Users' suggestion about adding an access to report phishing. | 1 | "...possibly a way to report malicious links." |

# Codebook for disagreement with AI agent (why participants believed the SMS was phishing despite the AI determined it was legitimate)
| **Code**| **Code Description** | **SubCode**  | **SubCode Description** | **Freq.** | **Examples**  |
|-------------|---------|----------------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Link-Related Concerns** | Distrust arises from the use of shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly) or URLs that don't align with well-known company domains. Users associate these with phishing attempts or scams. | Suspicious URLs  | Distrust due to the nature of links      | 10| "I insist that this message is fraudulent due to the nature of the link provided in the text message. Most often the easiest way to determine if a message is a scam is if a link looks randomly generated rather than an official link to a real website. So in this case bit.ly/3BOxxxx looks very illegitimate" |
|   |    | Link shorteners| Specific mention of shortened links as a red flag   | 4  | "bit.ly is a link shortener which I don't think a bank would use"  <br>  "In the case of my banking information I would always suspect a bit.ly address because I can't see the full address." |
| **Context Misalignment**  | Users are skeptical of messages that lack context, contradict their personal experiences, or deviate from expected norms. | Unclear or Misaligned Context      | The message content conflicts with the user's current situation or recent activities, failing to align with their expectations. | 8 | "I don't know if I requested validation, that is often said by phishing accounts to trip people up. I'd need to know whether I did, in fact, request validation. If I definitely had requested validation, I'd have marked this as legitimate."  <br>  "because I did not have any packages coming..." |
|     |  | Unfamiliar with Service | Users unaware of the service or context described in the message.     | 3 | "Of course I wasn't aware before reading the AI message that the bank had a program allowing payments at fuel stations. Off the cuff, it appeared to be an odd combination -- a bank and a gas station -- so I was suspicious even though the AI said it was legitimate..." |
| **Security Awareness**    | Users demonstrate a strong sense of security awareness and a suspicious nature when evaluating messages. | Verification Through Official Channels| Preference for manually verifying information.    | 5 | "...I always just google it myself and contact the bank if I think there's any issue."  <br>  "I would still rather check the official Walmart website or app instead of clicking the link..."|
|     |  | Avoiding Links in Messages | Users' policy of never clicking links in text messages.      | 4 | "...Caution is always necessary with SMS messages, especially those containing links. It's safer to verify directly through official bank channels before clicking any links."  <br>  "I'm just going to assume they're all fraudulent and never click links in messages..." |
|     |  | Heightened Caution for Sensitive Services    | Users exhibit heightened skepticism toward messages related to sensitive services, such as banking or financial transactions. | 4 | "...i in general do not trust text messages from banking sources."  <br>  "In the case of my banking information I would always suspect a bit.ly address because I can't see the full address."  |
|     |  | Data Sensitivity| Reluctance to provide personal information or images. | 2 | " I didn't like it because it was asking for a picture. I don't send my likeness to nobody."|
| **Message Content**| Users are skeptical of the content of the message text. | Unprofessional or Suspicious Wording | Distrust due to tone or style of communication.   | 3 | "I think is fraudulent since is asking to log in an account with angry communication."      |
|  |  | Generic Messaging      | Lack of personalization or use of generic greetings| 1 | "Generic Greeting: The message uses a generic salutation ("Dear Customer") instead of addressing the recipient by name. Legitimate communication from banks usually personalizes messages to their customers." |
| **Distrust in AI** | Skepticism Toward AI Judgments      ||   | 3 | "... I know that AI systems sometimes make mistakes, so I wasn't about to call this legitimate just because AI said so..."     |
| **Sender Information**    | Users are skeptical of messages when the sender's information appears suspicious.  ||   | 1 | "...the recipient through which the message is sent looks like its from a personal phone." |
| **Past Experience**| Users rely on their prior encounters with similar messages to inform their judgment. ||   | 1 | "I've received various forms of this specific text message before, of which I did not actually order anything."|



# Codebook for disagreement with AI agent (why participants believed the SMS was legitimate despite the AI determined it was phishing)

| **Code** | **Description** | **Freq.** | **Examples** |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Contextual alignment with legitimate expectations** | The SMS aligns with prior activity or typical practices, such as expecting a package delivery or receiving postal service notifications. | 3 | "The message mentions a package ready for delivery, which matches a delivery I was expecting from the postal service. The context aligns with recent activity, such as an online purchase or a tracking notification I received earlier." |
| **Absence of Sensitive Requests** | Users are more likely to consider a message legitimate if it does not explicitly request sensitive personal information, such as passwords, financial details, or identification documents. | 1 | "I was under the impression that this might be legitimate because it is not asking to provide any personal information." |
| **Distrust in AI's judgment on Redirection Classification** | Users do not trust the AI's judgement on the classification. Especially the URL redirection. | 1 | "I think the AI incorrectly labeled the URL redirection as fraudulent." |
