### 2.1 Test A (10 SMS)

>| **Legitimacy** | **Sender** |**SMS Body**| **Agent Report**     | **Detailed Report**       |**Screenshot**   |
>|---------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
>| **Legitimate** | 24273 |  Chase: You successfully validated your device and signed in. Call us, visit chase.com/xxx or use the app to manage your devices. | This SMS message appears to be legitimate. It mentions Chase, a well-known bank, and provides a direct link to Chase's official website, which is confirmed to be safe and matches their official domain. The message content is consistent with typical account security notifications and does not contain any signs of phishing, like urgent language or requests for personal information. You can safely follow the suggestions to visit Chase's website or use the app if you need to manage your devices. | The SMS appears to be legitimate based on several factors. First, it mentions Chase, a well-known financial institution, and refers to typical banking activity, such as device validation and account access. The URL provided in the SMS is 'https://chase.com/xxx', which is Chase's official domain, as confirmed in the brand search information. The redirect chain analysis also confirms that 'https://chase.com/xxx' redirects to 'https://www.chase.com/xxx', which is a common practice for official websites to manage traffic and security. The HTML content summary describes a legitimate banking website with various services that Chase offers, consistent with what one would expect from a financial institution like Chase. Furthermore, the domain information for 'chase.com/xxx' shows it is registered under MarkMonitor, Inc., a typical registrar for large companies, and it lists reputable name servers associated with JPMorgan Chase \& Co., confirming the legitimacy of the domain. There are no signs of phishing attempts, such as alarming language, grammatical errors, or requests for sensitive information in the SMS itself. The message content and URL align with communications one might expect from a bank regarding account security. |![Screenshot 1](img/screenshot_1.png)|
>| **Phishing** | (833) 528-0901 |  GOV: You are eligible for a discounted energy bill under the Energy Bills Support Scheme. You can apply here at: https://rebate.energy-uk-xxxxx.com | This message is likely a phishing attempt. The SMS impersonates the "Energy Bills Support Scheme" to sound trustworthy, but the link provided doesn't lead to an official or legitimate website related to the scheme. Instead, the website is suspicious, with signs that it was created recently and primarily exists for resale—typical traits of phishing sites. Do not click on the link or respond to the message; delete it immediately and consider reporting it to your mobile provider or relevant authorities. | The SMS claims to be associated with the 'Energy Bills Support Scheme'. However, the provided URL does not lead to any official or legitimate domain related to this scheme. The redirect chain ends at a domain that appears to be available for sale, indicating that it is not associated with any legitimate service. The webpage contains minimal content and lacks any detailed information related to energy claims or rebates. This aligns with typical characteristics of phishing attempts, where fraudulent domains are used. Furthermore, the domain was only recently created on January 7, 2024, and it seems to be primarily intended for resale or domain parking, which is a common indicator of a non-legitimate site. Additionally, the domain's registrar, TravelDomains, Incorporated, is not known for energy-related services. The absence of any identifiable connections to the actual Energy Bills Support Scheme reinforces that the SMS is likely a phishing attempt. It attempts to lure users by using a legitimate-sounding scheme name to deceive recipients into thinking the offer is real. The presence of a suspicious link aimed at misleading users aligns with phishing characteristics. |![Screenshot 2](img/screenshot_2.png)|
>| **Legitimate** | 61746 | Great news! You have 2 Walmart packages out for delivery, and they should arrive today. Track: https://w-mt.co/g/cZxxxx . Reply HELP for info; STOP to opt out. | The message appears legitimate and aligns with typical delivery notifications from Walmart. The link included in the SMS is associated with Walmart's official website, indicating that it likely directs you to a genuine page. However, if you weren't expecting a delivery, it's safest to check your orders by going directly to the Walmart website rather than clicking on the link in the message. This approach helps protect your information and ensures you're interacting only with verified sources. | The SMS claims to deliver a notification about Walmart packages, which is a common service provided by legitimate organizations. The URL provided in the SMS undergoes a redirection chain and eventually appears to lead to Walmart's official website, suggesting legitimacy. The domain information for the URL shows that it is registered to 'Walmart.com', which matches the brand name being referenced in the SMS, adding credibility to the message. Additionally, domain registration details like the registrar 'CSC CORPORATE DOMAINS, INC.' and its long-standing creation date from 1995 indicate a well-established domain. The presence of a CAPTCHA-like verification page is common for high-traffic and e-commerce websites to differentiate between bots and legitimate users, contributing further to the SMS's legitimacy. The footer links to terms of use and privacy policy also align with standard practices for authentic sites, ensuring compliance with user privacy standards. The screenshot analysis indicates that this page serves as a security measure, common for legitimate entities to protect their consumers. |![Screenshot 3](img/screenshot_3.png)|
>| **Phishing** | (800) 275-8777 | [US POSTAL] Your package is ready for delivery. Confirm your address to avoid returns: https://dik.si/postal/xxx | This SMS message is likely a phishing attempt. It claims to be from “US POSTAL” and urges you to confirm your address to avoid returns, but the link provided (https://dik.si/postal/xxx) is unrelated to any official postal service and leads to a “404 Not Found” page, which isn't typical for legitimate delivery notifications. This inconsistency suggests the message is trying to trick you into providing personal information. Do not click on the link or reply; instead, if you have delivery concerns, contact the official postal service directly through their verified website or customer service. | The SMS claims to be from 'US POSTAL' and involves package delivery, a common cover for phishing attempts. The URL provided (https://dik.si/postal/xxx) does not redirect to any relevant shipping information but rather leads to a whimsical '404 Not Found' error page with no connection to the USPS brand, which strongly suggests it does not serve a legitimate purpose related to the message's content. The domain dik.si is unrelated to US POSTAL, as verified by the search results, which list official USPS domains but not dik.si. This inconsistency raises suspicion as it diverges from the known US POSTAL web addresses. Despite the domain registration appearing standard, the lack of an actual delivery service presence indicates potential phishing intent aimed at collecting user data under false pretenses of package delivery confirmation. |![Screenshot 4](img/screenshot_4.png)|
>| **Legitimate** | (800) 347-2683 | Dear Customer, your ICICI Bank FASTag can now be used for fuel payments at HPCL and IOCL fuel outlets. Details at bit.ly/3BOxxxx . T\&C apply.  | This SMS message appears legitimate. It promotes ICICI Bank's FASTag service, allowing payments at specific fuel stations, which aligns with known services offered by the bank. There are no suspicious requests for sensitive information, and the website link leads to a page affiliated with ICICI Bank, confirming its credibility. You can safely view the link for more details if you are interested in this service.  | The SMS appears to be legitimate based on several factors. Firstly, it promotes a specific service provided by ICICI Bank related to FASTag usage for fuel payments at HPCL and IOCL outlets. This corresponds with known offerings by the bank and does not fall into high-risk categories like online gambling or lottery. The detailed description and promotional elements on the destination webpage align with ICICI Bank's official services. The redirect chain eventually leads to a page with an ICICI Bank domain, which strengthens the legitimacy of the message. Additionally, the brand search results confirm that ICICI Bank provides these services, matching the information provided in the SMS. The domain registration details are consistent with those of ICICI Bank, being registered long ago and updated regularly, indicating a well-maintained domain. No grammatical or spelling errors in the SMS content or on the destination webpage raise suspicion. There are no requests for sensitive information, further supporting that this is an informational promotion rather than a phishing attempt. Thus, all aspects confirm that this SMS is from a legitimate source, ICICI Bank, providing information about a recognized service and promotion.  |![Screenshot 5](img/screenshot_5.png)|
>| **Phishing** | (888) 838-4366 | We regret to inform you that your Netflix membership has been placed on hold due to issues with your billing information. We kindly request to update your billing information as soon as possible to continue using your account without any interruption. To update your billing information, please follow the instructions by click on link below : https://restartmmberswebxxxx.uscreen.io/ Netflix Services  | This message appears to be a phishing attempt. Although it claims to be from Netflix, the link provided does not direct you to Netflix's official website but instead to an unrelated site, which is suspicious. Phishing messages often use urgent language, like warning about account issues, to trick people into clicking links and providing sensitive information. Do not click on any links in this message. Instead, check your account directly on Netflix's official app or website for any issues. | The SMS claims to be from Netflix, indicating that a problem exists with the billing information of the recipient's membership. The URL provided redirects ultimately to www.uscreen.tv, which is a legitimate platform for video content creators, not related to Netflix. This discrepancy signals a potential phishing attempt, as the final domain does not match Netflix's verified domain. Brand impersonation is evident, suggesting malicious intent. Furthermore, the message uses urgent language to prompt immediate action, a common phishing technique. The redirect chain's initial link is unfamiliar, and no legitimate Netflix domains are present in the final redirect destination. The SMS format and request for updating billing information match typical phishing patterns of attempting to acquire sensitive information under fraudulent pretenses. The additional characteristics of legitimate websites, such as Netflix, are absent, further indicating that the message is not authentic. |![Screenshot 6](img/screenshot_6.png)|
>| **Legitimate** | 6700 | It's the last month of your Mint 3 Month Unlimited plan. How time flies. Log into your account at my.mintmobile.com/xxxx or use our app to renew your plan. | The SMS message appears to be legitimate and is likely from Mint Mobile, notifying you that your 3-month unlimited plan is ending and prompting you to renew. The website link, my.mintmobile.com/xxxx, matches Mint Mobile's official domain, which is a good sign. However, as a safety measure, you may want to avoid clicking directly on the link in the message; instead, open the Mint Mobile website or app independently to renew your plan. This ensures you are using a secure, verified platform to access your account. | The SMS appears to be a legitimate communication from Mint Mobile, a known mobile service provider. The SMS content indicates it's a notification about the end of a user's 3-month unlimited plan and encourages the user to log into their account to renew the plan, which aligns with typical legitimate account update messages from mobile service providers. The domain my.mintmobile.com/xxxx, associated with the SMS, is consistent with the legitimate brand Mint Mobile. The domain registration details show a long-term creation date and an expiration date in 2027, registered with GoDaddy, which adds to its credibility. The redirect chain leads to an https version of the domain, and the implementation of robot-human verification is common on legitimate sites to secure user access. The screenshot and HTML content summaries depict a legitimate login page for Mint Mobile, complementing the brand's friendly image with its mascot, in line with standard user account management practices. The brand search information and the URL my.mintmobile.com/xxxx do not directly indicate phishing activity or any mismatch with the legitimate Mint Mobile brand identity.  |![Screenshot 7](img/screenshot_7.png)|
>| **Legitimate** | 6700 |  Need to set up data and picture messaging? We will be sending you a message with instructions shortly. Or check out bit.ly/mintapn/xxxx at anytime. | This SMS message appears to be legitimate. It provides instructions on setting up data and picture messaging, and the link directs users to Mint Mobile's setup page for iPhone, a reliable source for such help. The message does not contain any urgent requests, threats, or unusual language, which are common in phishing messages. You can safely follow the instructions in this message if you need to set up data and picture messaging on your Mint Mobile account. | The SMS provides guidance on setting up data and picture messaging and includes a link to further instructions. The redirect chain confirms the link leads to Mint Mobile's setup page for iPhones, suggesting relevance to the message content. Despite the '403 Forbidden' error restricting access to the setup page, this typically results from server-side configurations intended to prevent unauthorized access, not phishing. The domain mintmobile.com is registered under a legitimate registrar, GoDaddy.com, and has been active since 2010, further supporting credibility. The domain's long registration and standard ICANN statuses align with legitimate practices. Additionally, the screenshot and HTML summary describe a genuine help article on configuring iPhone settings with proper Mint Mobile branding, layout, and relevant information for users. No phishing characteristics such as urgent language, requests for personal info, or grammatical errors are present. Although searching 'mint' yields results for Intuit's Mint financial app, the specific subject and context of the SMS align with Mint Mobile's offerings, thereby validating the SMS's legitimacy. |![Screenshot 8](img/screenshot_8.png)|
>| **Phishing** | (632) 8841-8600 | Good Day! Your Union Bank account has been flagged for fraudulent transaction. Your account will be disabled in 24 hours. Verify your account here: https://tinyurl.com/UBPVerify/xxx Good Day! We would like to notify Union Bank users about the data breach happened yesterday. Affected users will receive this message. To avoid disabling of account in 24 hours, update your details here: https://online.unionbankph.com/xxxx: verify@kalapradarshini.com | This SMS message is likely a phishing attempt. It uses urgent language about a "fraudulent transaction" and claims that your account will be disabled, which is a common tactic to scare people into acting quickly. The link includes a suspicious email address, and the shortened URL is flagged for violating usage terms, indicating potential abuse. Do not click any links or provide personal details. If you have concerns about your account, contact Union Bank directly through their official website or customer service. | The SMS claims to be from Union Bank and mentions fraudulent activity with an urgent call to verify account details, a prevalence in phishing attempts using alarmist language. The TinyURL link provided in the SMS directs to a terminated page due to violation of TinyURL's Terms of Use, often linked with abusive activities like phishing, reinforcing suspicion. The legitimate URL for Union Bank (online.unionbankph.com) is used in the SMS, suggesting some validity. The brand information retrieved indicates Union Bank Philippines operates under unionbankph.com, matching the domain used. However, the presence of an email address in the URL is suspicious, as legitimate financial institutions typically advise against sensitive information exchange via email-phishing tactic signs. Despite the authentic URL, such pairing with an invalidation alongside a shortened link potentially further confirms deception. Security advisories on legitimate sites are good practice yet, matched with spam tactics diminish credibility. |![Screenshot 9 1](img/screenshot_9_1.png) <br> ![Screenshot 9 2](img/screenshot_9_2.png)|
>| **Phishing** | 32665 | Instagram Hello,Someone tried to log into your Instagram account. If it was you,please confirm your iden***y: Click on the link http://mbltext.com/owxxx | This message is phishing. It pretends to be from Instagram but provides a website link that redirects to a Facebook page, which doesn't match the claim of the message. The use of urgency, asking you to confirm your identity, is a common trick to make you act quickly without thinking. Do not click on the link; instead, check the Instagram app or website directly for any account alerts.| The SMS claims to be related to Instagram by stating that someone tried to log into the user's Instagram account. However, the URL provided (http://mbltext.com/owxxx) redirects to a Facebook page related to a group named 'Lularoe Pop-up Mall'. This is inconsistent with the original claim of being from Instagram. Additionally, the redirect chain reveals that it ends at a Facebook group login page, which requires logging into Facebook, not Instagram. The domain information shows that the URL is legitimate and part of Facebook, but it is not aligned with Instagram, which it claims to represent in the SMS. The presence of the link in a situation involving account access without directly taking recipients to an official Instagram page raises suspicion. Finally, there is a hint of urgency in the message saying that someone tried to log into the account, requiring confirmation. This attempt to create urgency without a clear direction to the legitimate brand's website indicates phishing behavior. |![Screenshot 10](img/screenshot_10.png)|

Hope you enjoy using our product to unlock the power of interoperability & liquidity between blockchain ecosystems. Click to see your demos: https://tinyurl.com/3p7exxxx | The SMS message you received appears legitimate. It includes a verification code, which is typical for account setup or login, and links to a professional website for Gravity Bridge—a known service in blockchain interoperability. There are no signs of fraud, like urgent language or requests for personal details. You can proceed safely, but avoid sharing verification codes with anyone else for security. | The SMS appears to be legitimate as it references a verification code, which is a common feature of account creation or sign-in processes. Additionally, the website linked through the SMS leads to an informative, professional page for Gravity Bridge, which describes a blockchain interoperability service connecting Ethereum and Cosmos. The domain 'pages.dev' is registered with Cloudflare and has been active since 2020, supporting its legitimacy. The content and structure of the website emphasize technical blockchain features, resources, and community engagement without any signs of fraudulent intent. Moreover, there are no urgent calls for personal information or alarming language, and the URL structure aligns with the content focus on blockchain, which matches the SMS context. |![AI mistake](img/AI_mistake.png)|

## 4. Exit Questions
### 4.1 **Explaining Disagreement with the AI**
If a participant chooses a different answer from the AI's suggestion after viewing the AI's explanation, they will be asked to explain their reasoning. We classify human-AI disagreements into two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: Insisting on their own opinion.**  
  The user maintains their original judgment and disregards the AI's conflicting suggestion.
- **Scenario 2: Changing their opinion.**  
  The user's initial judgment aligns with the AI's suggestion, but after reading the AI explanation, they change their mind and select a different answer from the AI's.

The following questions will appear if a disagreement occurs. If multiple disagreements arise in the same scenario, only the most recent case will be shown to the participant.

> **Scenario 1:**  
> *We want to ask some follow-up questions about a specific case. For the message below, your selection was: ..... The AI suggested that this SMS is ..... After reading the AI report, you insisted that this SMS is ..... Can you explain why you disagree with the AI's report?*

> **Scenario 2:**  
> *We want to ask a follow-up question about a specific case. For the message below, your selection was: ..... The AI also suggested that this SMS is .... . However, after reading the AI report, you changed your mind and selected ..... Can you explain why you changed your mind?*

For Test B, the disagreement clarification question is always triggered whenever there is a disagreement with the AI's suggestion in the case where the AI made a mistake.

>Below is a screenshot showing the disagreement open-text question interface:
